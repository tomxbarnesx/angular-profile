# AngularProfile
A simple profile-creation application built with Angular 7, Express, MongoDB and Node. Users can create, update, destroy and view profiles they create. For the purposes of this exercise, no limits were added on the number of profiles one can create. It acts, then, as a digital Rolodex of sorts, with one-page smoothness.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Be sure to also run a local MongoDB server and shell, as well as a node server in order to interact with backend.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
